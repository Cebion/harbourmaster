# PortMaster w/ HarbourMaster - Public Beta v0.4.4

PortMaster is a convenient script designed to facilitate the downloading and installation of ports for handheld devices. As the number of available ports has increased, the original interface has become progressively cumbersome. However, we have been diligently working on developing an enhanced backend to transform PortMaster into a more advanced frontend, ultimately incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) which will make showcasing, discovery and installation of ports.

We are delighted to present the first public beta for a version of PortMaster, which integrates the old PortMaster frontend with the new HarbourMaster backend.

The updated backend offers several notable advantages, including:

- **Installation of ports from various repositories**: Users can now access and install ports from multiple different repositories, expanding their options and providing greater flexibility.
- **Port uninstallation**: The new backend enables the removal of installed ports, allowing users to manage their collection more effectively and free up storage space when needed.
- **Downloadable Runtimes**: Ports can now use various shared runtimes simplifying the creation and distribution of ports. Godot / Mono / Java are the runtimes we currently have, but we also have plans for more in the future.
- **Genre-based port listing**: To simplify the process of discovering new ports from the extensive selection, the new backend categorizes ports by genres. This categorization makes it easier for users to navigate and find ports that align with their preferences, avoiding the overwhelming nature of a single comprehensive list.

We are looking forward to your help in testing this version, which represents the initial step in the evolution of PortMaster towards an even more user-friendly and feature-rich experience.
